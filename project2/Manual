Please read the following guidelines before using the calculator.

1.You can input any expression containing numbers, operators, brackets and math functions.
2.Allowed numbers: integers, floating-point numbers, numbers written in scientific notation.
3.Allowed operators: +, -, *, /, =.
4.Allowed brackets: (), [].
5.Allowed math functions: max{}, min{}, pow{}, abs{}.
6.Precedence: [] > math functions > () > *,/ > +,-.
7.Negative numbers are expressed as '_N', where 'N' is any positive number.
8.'()' can only be nested in '[]'.
9.Negative numbers don't need '()' to enclose them.
10.The arguments in the math functions can only be numbers.
11.The power of a number can only be integer.
12.When you use sqrt{n}, you are recommended to input an "n" smaller than 50. Otherwise, it 
will take you quite a long time to get the result.
13.If your input expression contains any invalid values among operators, the calculator will
warn you; but if the operators or math functions in your expression are wrong, the calculator 
will not warn you. So please pay attention to the validity of your input expression.
14.You'd better not use letters in the alphabet as the names of variables when your expression
contains some math functions and numbers written in scientific notation.
